# This repo has several projects, each residing in their own directory

## Most of the code is from a ![course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) on React by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller

I created this repository to have code access across devices and to use file diffs to remember the code changes

---
If you want to run the app
simply `cd` to the project directory and run `npm install` and then `npm run start`
